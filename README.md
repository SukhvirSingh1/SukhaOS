# SukhaOS 🚀
**Leveling up life through code.**

SukhaOS is a comprehensive, modular desktop application built to manage the daily operations of a student developer. Inspired by James Clear's *Atomic Habits*, this system centralizes skill acquisition, financial tracking, and physical health into one unified interface.

## 🌟 Key Pillars
- **Skill Engine**: Track hours spent on Python and Video Editing.
- **Finance Module**: A robust SQLite-integrated expense tracker.
- **Health Lab**: Progressive overload tracking for workouts.
- **Mind & Thoughts**: Daily logs and reflection journals.
- **Academic Manager**: Task tracking for Class 11/12 studies.

## 🛠️ Technical Stack
- **Language**: Python 3.x
- **GUI Framework**: Tkinter (Modular Frame-based architecture)
- **Database**: SQLite3 (Relational data storage)
- **Logic**: Lambda-based dynamic navigation and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).

## 🏗️ Architecture
SukhaOS uses a **Modular UI pattern**. Instead of multiple windows, it utilizes a single-window "Deck" system where frames are raised (`tkraise`) based on sidebar navigation. This ensures low memory overhead and a clean User Experience (UX).
